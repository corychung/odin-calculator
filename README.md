# The Odin Project: Calculator

This is my calculator project as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, currently [live on Github pages.](https://corychung.github.io/odin-calculator/)

I am pretty proud of how this turnt out, although I really do think I could clean up the JS logic to be a bit nicer. It was fun doing the HTML and CSS and tweaking that so that it actually feels more interactive to use. Additionally, it was a fun challenge to figure out the logic for the JS. I did a few flowcharts and used "scratch paper" to figure out the logic and then implementing it, using different states and toggles was interesting to learn. Overall this was a very fun project and it taught me a lot about JS.

In the future I would like to take a second look at the logic and revamp it to be more concise and readable. Right now it is a bit of spaghetti code so I would like to take a second shot at it.
